_In this section, Prof. Aram Harrow describes how teaching recitations in_ 8.05 Quantum Physics II _helps him anticipate material students might find challenging during_ 8.06 Quantum Physics III _lectures._

{{< quote "Getting to know students during the 8.05 recitations helps me identify concepts they may find challenging during 8.06 lectures." "— Aram Harrow" >}}

_8.06 Quantum III_ is a continuation of _[8.05 Quantum Physics II](/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/)__._  I teach recitation sessions in 8.05, and then I teach many of the same students during lectures in 8.06. Getting to know students during the 8.05 recitations helps me identify concepts they may find challenging during 8.06 lectures. This is particularly helpful as I tend not to get extensive feedback from students during lectures about what they misunderstand.

I also have experience teaching recitations for _8.06 Quantum Physics III_. Within the physics department, it’s not uncommon to teach recitations before lecturing in a course. It’s great when this can happen because recitations are where students work through the course material and you, as the instructor, get to understand how they’re thinking about the material and where their misconceptions lie.
